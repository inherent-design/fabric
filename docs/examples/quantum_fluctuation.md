# Quantum Fluctuation Concurrency Model

[← Back to Examples Index](../EXAMPLES.md)

This document provides an overview of the "Quantum Fluctuation" concurrency model implemented in Fabric, focusing on how we coordinate concurrent access to shared resources.

## Core Principles

The Quantum Fluctuation concurrency model is based on several key principles:

1. **Intent Declaration**: Explicitly stating the purpose of a lock acquisition
2. **Awareness Propagation**: Communicating lock priorities between different parts of the system
3. **Lock Coordination**: Allowing locks to interact with each other intelligently
4. **Timeout Protection**: Preventing indefinite waits with proper timeout mechanisms
5. **Lock Hierarchies**: Following consistent hierarchy to prevent deadlocks

## Implementation Features

The model is primarily implemented in the `CoordinatedGraph` class, providing thread-safe graph operations with:

### Lock Intent Types

- **Read**: For read-only operations (lowest priority)
- **NodeModify**: For operations that modify node data but not graph structure
- **GraphStructure**: For operations that modify the graph structure (highest priority)

### Lock Status Notifications

- **Acquired**: Lock has been successfully acquired
- **Released**: Lock has been released
- **Preempted**: Lock has been preempted by higher priority
- **BackgroundWait**: Lock is temporarily waiting for structural changes
- **Failed**: Lock acquisition failed

## Lock Coordination

When a high-priority operation (like a structural change) needs to acquire locks, the system notifies existing lock holders. This allows lower-priority operations to know when higher-priority operations are waiting, enabling them to:

- Complete more quickly
- Release locks sooner
- Gracefully yield resources
- Temporarily pause execution

## Timeout Protection

All lock acquisition operations have timeout protection to prevent indefinite waiting. This ensures that even in highly contended scenarios, operations will either succeed within a reasonable time or fail gracefully.

## ResourceHub Implementation

The `ResourceHub` class builds on the `CoordinatedGraph` to provide thread-safe resource management:

- Synchronous and asynchronous resource loading
- Resource dependency tracking
- Memory budget enforcement with graceful eviction
- Processing resources in dependency order

## Best Practices

To effectively use the Quantum Fluctuation concurrency model:

1. **Always declare your intent**: Use the most appropriate lock intent for your operation
2. **Use the smallest scope possible for locks**: Release locks as soon as they're no longer needed
3. **Follow the lock hierarchy**: Graph locks → Node locks, never the reverse
4. **Handle lock acquisition failures gracefully**: Always check if lock acquisition succeeded
5. **Use timeout protection**: Specify appropriate timeouts for your operations
6. **Consider using local copies**: Make local copies of data to minimize lock duration
7. **Register callbacks for coordination**: Use callbacks to react to lock status changes

## Future Directions

The Quantum Fluctuation model will continue to evolve with enhancements such as:

- Lock acquisition with priorities
- Improved lock acquisition ordering
- Enhanced deadlock detection
- Automatic lock coordination for complex operations
