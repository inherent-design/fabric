# Fabric Engine Examples

[← Back to Documentation Index](DOCUMENTATION.md)

This document serves as an index for the various examples demonstrating core Fabric Engine concepts and implementations. These examples showcase how to use the API to build components, handle events, manage lifecycle, and implement plugins.

## Overview

The examples demonstrate the key components and concepts of the Fabric Engine architecture:

### Basic Component Structure

Learn how to create UI components with type-safe properties and implement the component lifecycle methods (initialize, render, update, cleanup).

[View Example →](examples/basic_component.md)

### Event Handling and Propagation

Explore the event system, including how to create events, handle them, and control event propagation through the component hierarchy.

[View Example →](examples/event_handling.md)

### Component Lifecycle Management 

Use the lifecycle manager to control component states and register hooks for lifecycle transitions.

[View Example →](examples/lifecycle_management.md)

### Plugin System Integration

Create and register plugins to extend the Fabric Engine with custom components and functionality.

[View Example →](examples/plugin_system.md)

### Type-Safe Property System

Learn how to use the type-safe property system to store and retrieve component data safely.

[View Example →](examples/property_system.md)

### Multi-Scale Perspective Framework

See how the component system can be adapted to implement the perspective-fluid architecture where reality adapts based on the observer's perspective.
