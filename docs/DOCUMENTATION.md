## Quick Start

If you're new to Fabric Engine, we recommend starting with the following:

1. Read the [Architecture](ARCHITECTURE.md) document for an overview of the system
2. Follow the [Build Guide](BUILD.md) to set up your development environment
3. Explore the [Examples](EXAMPLES.md) to understand key concepts
4. Review the [Roadmap](ROADMAP.md) to see where the project is headed

## Architecture Components

Fabric Engine consists of several key architectural components:

- **Core Components**: The foundation of the Fabric Engine
  - [Component System](ARCHITECTURE.md#core-components)
  - [Event System](ARCHITECTURE.md#core-components)
  - [Lifecycle Management](ARCHITECTURE.md#core-components)
  - [Plugin Architecture](ARCHITECTURE.md#core-components)

- **Quantum Fluctuation Update**: Advanced perspective-fluid features
  - [Command Pattern & Action System](QUANTUM_FLUCTUATION.md#1-command-pattern--action-system)
  - [Reactive Programming Model](QUANTUM_FLUCTUATION.md#2-reactive-programming-model)
  - [Resource Management Framework](QUANTUM_FLUCTUATION.md#3-resource-management-framework)
  - [Scale-Aware Scene System](QUANTUM_FLUCTUATION.md#4-spatial-primitives--scene-graph)
  - [Temporal Dimension System](QUANTUM_FLUCTUATION.md#5-temporal-dimension-system)

- **External Integrations**:
  - SDL3 for windowing and rendering
  - WebView for UI rendering

## Development Guides

- [Contributing Guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md#contribution-guidelines)
- [Coding Standards](CONTRIBUTING.md#coding-standards)
- [Testing Procedures](TESTING.md#testing-philosophy)
- [Build Process](BUILD.md#build-process)

## Core Concepts

Fabric Engine introduces several unique concepts:

- **Perspective Fluidity**: Reality adapts to your perspective
- **Quanta**: Information particles that shape-shift based on observation
- **Scopes**: Reality containers that define rules within your current perspective
- **Mesosphere**: The stage where your consciousness currently performs
- **Scale Transitions**: Seamless movement between different scales of reality
