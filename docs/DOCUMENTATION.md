# Fabric Engine Documentation

## Overview

Welcome to the Fabric Engine documentation. This guide serves as a central hub for all documentation resources related to the Fabric Engine project.

## Core Documentation

| Document | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| [Architecture](ARCHITECTURE.md) | Detailed architecture of the Fabric Engine |
| [Build Guide](BUILD.md) | Instructions for building the project on different platforms |
| [Concurrency](CONCURRENCY.md) | Thread safety and coordination approach |
| [Testing Guide](TESTING.md) | Overview of the testing framework and procedures |
| [Roadmap](ROADMAP.md) | Project roadmap and feature implementation timeline |
| [Technical Challenges](TECHNICAL_CHALLENGES.md) | Key technical challenges and implementation considerations |
| [Contributing](CONTRIBUTING.md) | Guidelines for contributing to the project |
| [Examples](EXAMPLES.md) | Code examples demonstrating key concepts |

## Quick Start

If you're new to Fabric Engine, we recommend starting with the following:

1. Read the [Architecture](ARCHITECTURE.md) document for an overview of the system
2. Follow the [Build Guide](BUILD.md) to set up your development environment
3. Explore the [Examples](EXAMPLES.md) to understand key concepts
4. Review the [Roadmap](ROADMAP.md) to see where the project is headed

## Architecture Components

Fabric Engine consists of several key architectural components:

- **Core Components**: The foundation of the Fabric Engine
  - [Component System](ARCHITECTURE.md#core-components)
  - [Event System](ARCHITECTURE.md#core-components)
  - [Lifecycle Management](ARCHITECTURE.md#core-components)
  - [Plugin Architecture](ARCHITECTURE.md#core-components)

- **Quantum Fluctuation Update**: Advanced perspective-fluid features
  - [Command Pattern & Action System](examples/quantum_fluctuation.md)
  - [Reactive Programming Model](examples/quantum_fluctuation.md)
  - [Resource Management with CoordinatedGraph](CONCURRENCY.md)
  - [Scale-Aware Scene System](examples/quantum_fluctuation.md)
  - [Temporal Dimension System](examples/quantum_fluctuation.md)

- **External Integrations**:
  - SDL3 for windowing and rendering
  - WebView for UI rendering

## Development Guides

- [Contributing Guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md#contribution-guidelines)
- [Coding Standards](CONTRIBUTING.md#coding-standards)
- [Testing Procedures](TESTING.md#testing-philosophy)
- [Build Process](BUILD.md#build-process)

## Technical Guides

| Guide | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| [Graph Theory](guides/GRAPH_THEORY.md) | Explores how graph theory principles apply to resource management |
| [Concurrency](CONCURRENCY.md) | Details the intent-based concurrency strategy in Fabric |
| [Resource Management](guides/RESOURCE_MANAGEMENT.md) | Practical guide to the graph-based resource management system |
| [Von Neumann Graph Processing](guides/VON_NEUMANN_GRAPHS.md) | Theoretical analysis of graph algorithms on classical CPU architectures |
| [Implementation Patterns](guides/IMPLEMENTATION_PATTERNS.md) | Practical patterns for working with concurrent graph systems |

## Core Concepts

Fabric Engine introduces several unique concepts:

- **Perspective Fluidity**: Reality adapts to your perspective
- **Quanta**: Information particles that shape-shift based on observation
- **Scopes**: Reality containers that define rules within your current perspective
- **Mesosphere**: The stage where your consciousness currently performs
- **Scale Transitions**: Seamless movement between different scales of reality
