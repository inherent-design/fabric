# ðŸŒŒ Fabric Engine

*Reality is fluid. Perspective is everything.*

## Overview

Fabric Engine shatters conventional information hierarchies by creating a framework where reality adapts to your perspective. What appears as an atom from one viewpoint becomes a universe from anotherâ€”no fixed scales, only fluid perception.

Inspired by games like Star Citizen, Stellaris, and Fractal Block World, Fabric provides the tools to build applications where users can seamlessly traverse multiple scales of realityâ€”from subatomic to cosmicâ€”while maintaining coherent state and perspective-appropriate interactions.

> *"The mesosphere isn't a fixed scale but the stage where your consciousness currently performs."*

## Core Concepts

- **Quanta** - Information particles that shape-shift based on how you observe them
- **Scopes** - Reality containers that define the rules within your current perspective
- **Transformations** - Temporal flows that evolve information across states
- **Perspectives** - The viewpoints that determine your active mesosphere
- **Boundaries** - The bleeding edges where perception fades into quantum uncertainty or statistical blur

When you shift perspective toward any quantum, it becomes your new mesosphereâ€”complete with its own micro and macro horizons. You don't just see different things; you redefine what "things" are.

## Current Features

- **Cross-Platform Core**: Windows, macOS, and Linux support
- **WebView Integration**: Native webview with bidirectional JavaScript bridge
- **Command-Line Interface**: Robust argument parsing and validation
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error management system
- **Logging System**: Multi-level logging with formatting options

## Implementation

The Fabric Engine is built with a modular architecture that supports perspective-fluid information processing:

- **Quantum Core**: Fundamentally mutable foundation that adapts to perspective
- **Scope System**: Defines the rules of reality for particular viewpoints
- **Transformation Engine**: Enables temporal evolution within and between scopes
- **Perspective Manager**: Controls active viewpoints and scale relationships
